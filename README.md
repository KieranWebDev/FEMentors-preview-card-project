## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first design

### What I learned

- My first challenge using the Figma design files as a reference. It really helped to improve the accuracy of my completed component.

- A good opportunity to brush up on the fundamentals and get some practice with responsive design and building using mobile-first design

- I had some trouble getting the background color on the image to closely match the design spec. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing how others handled this challenge once I submit my solution.

### Continued development

I plan to revisit this challenge and rebuild it with react and tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- [Get rid of that small space under your images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plOl7TNc89A&t=244s) - This helped me with the CSS on the main image.
